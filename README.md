How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

<We begin the process of interpreting user needs with an interview with the client. This initial and very critical step is where we determine the features, timeline, and product overall. Once we understand the User’s needs, we can begin to create “user stories” that incorporate these needs and prioritize them into detailed information sheets that can give the team direction regarding development.>


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

<I approach developing programs from an informed point of view, I like to be fully aware of what the client wants and how to get there. By first developing the framework for a successful agile methodology we can avoid pitfalls and move towards our goals with modular development. I hope to incorporate further agile organizational methods and software into my future work.>


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

<Being a good team member starts with communication. It is the most basic facet of any team, no matter the industry. Not only must a good team member communicate, but they must communicate well, with efficiency and the freedom to express ideas and concerns regarding the project. A good team member also understands their role and responsibilities within a team and is able to accountable to said duties.>
